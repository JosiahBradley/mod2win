Welcome to level 1 mod!

Exploration of variables is your goal in this mod file.

A variable is a type of storage that a program uses to save values. Think of them as a box you can put things into.
Sometimes the box can hold certain things and sometimes it is better for other items. This concept in programming is
called typing or variable type.

Variables have names and that is how we refer to them when we want to get their contents.

A name can be a word that describes what you want your variable to do.

Example variable names:
 * age
 * school
 * grade
 * my_name
 * favorite_color
 * really_long_variable_name_that_you_should_avoid_but_still_be_descriptive

After you give your variable a name you need to assign it a value. We do this Python using the = sign

Example assignment:
 * age = 32
 * school = "Barry University"
 * grade = 16
 * my_name = "Josiah Bradley"
 * favorite_color = "Green"
 * really_long_variable_name_that_you_should_avoid_but_still_be_descriptive = None

Some types you may run into are numbers, or words, or special combinations of these.

Number types include integers and floating point numbers (think decimals)

In Python we call integers: int
and we call decimal numbers: float

Example int:
 * a = 1
 * b = 2000
 * foo = 1234567890987654321

Example float:
 * temperature = 98.6
 * money = 10.51
 * pi = 3.141592653589793

Words in Python are called strings, or str.
Strings can even contain numbers or symbols.
When we assign these variables we need a way for Python to understand the words.
This is done by using a matching pair of quotes: ' or "
Either can be used as long as they surround the word(s) and match.

Example str:
 * name = "Clifford"
 * size = 'Big'
 * color = "Red"
 * pet = 'Dog'
 * book = "Title of really cool book"
 * password = '4$5gsuRhnj7asi!'

Sometimes we want to collect multiple numbers or words at the same time.
We have four ways to do this in Python, each with their own unique properties.

Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries.

Lists are like a shopping list, they have a bunch of items you want to use for one purpose.
You can store numbers or words in lists and they can grow in size to hold more variables.
You can even put list inside of list to create complex structures, but we will go over that later.

Lists can be created using [] or list()

Example List:
 * numbers = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
 * letters = [ 'A', 'B', 'C' ]
 * words = [ "dog", "cat", "turtle" ]
 * tic_tac_toe = [ [ 'X', 'O', 'X' ], [ 'O', 'X', 'O'], [ 'O', 'X', 'O' ] ]

Tuples are special types of list that can't change size or their contents. This is useful for
defining things like colors or points on a graph.

Tuples can be created using () or tuple()

Example tuple:
 * location = (3, 8)
 * sky_blue = (135, 206, 235)
 * best_words ('Python', 'Programming', 'Game')

Sets and Dictionaries are more advances and will be used in later modules.

You'll have access to the following variables:

  * speed: Number (int or float)
  * water: Number (int or float)
  * color: tuple of 3 numbers between 1 and 255 like (1, 2, 3)

You'll need to manipulate these to find out what they do.

Ready, SET, go!
